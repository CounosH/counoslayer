What is the Counos Layer
----------------------
The Counos Layer is a communications protocol that uses the CounosH block chain to enable features such as smart contracts, user currencies and decentralized peer-to-peer exchanges. A common analogy that is used to describe the relation of the Counos Layer to CounosH is that of HTTP to TCP/IP: HTTP, like the Counos Layer, is the application layer to the more fundamental transport and internet layer of TCP/IP, like CounosH.

What is Counos Core
-----------------

Counos Core is a fast, portable Counos Layer implementation that is based off the CounosH Core codebase (currently 0.20.1). This implementation requires no external dependencies extraneous to CounosH Core, and is native to the CounosH network just like other CounosH nodes. It currently supports a wallet mode and is seamlessly available on three platforms: Windows, Linux and Mac OS. Counos Layer extensions are exposed via the UI and the JSON-RPC interface. Development has been consolidated on the Counos Core product, and it is the reference client for the Counos Layer.
